# Lab 5

## Running

`python server.py` to run the server process

`python tester.py` to run the testing process (requires running server process)

## Implementation Detail

I ran this on my local machine because codespaces refused to play nicely.

I used a separate python script to test endpoints instead of cURL because that
seemed like a far easier way to methodically test the validity of responses
